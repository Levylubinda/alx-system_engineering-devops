A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented. Getting comfortable with API calls now can save you some face during technical interviews and even outside of the job market, you might find personal use cases to make your life a little bit easier

What is advanced API?
Apigee's Advanced API Operations (AAPI Ops) provides tools to help you ensure that your APIs stay up and running as intended. AAPI Ops automatically detects unusual patterns in API traffic—called anomalies—such as spikes in latency or error rate. Anomalies can be a sign of issues with your API's performance.
